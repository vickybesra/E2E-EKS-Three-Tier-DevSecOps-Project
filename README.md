## Application Code
The `app/` directory contains the source code for the Three-Tier Web Application. Dive into this directory to explore the frontend and backend implementations.

## Jenkins Pipeline Code
In the `jenkins/pipelines/` directory, you'll find Jenkins pipeline scripts. These scripts automate the CI/CD process, ensuring smooth integration and deployment of your application.

## Jenkins Server With Terraform
Explore the `tf/files/jenkins/` directory to find Terraform scripts for setting up the Jenkins Server on AWS and `tf/files/eks/` for eks with modules that demonstrates the practical steps to set up and automate an EKS cluster. These scripts simplify the infrastructure provisioning process.

## Kubernetes Manifests Files
The `k8s/manifests/` directory holds Kubernetes manifests for deploying your application on AWS EKS. Understand and customize these files to suit your project needs.

## Project Details
🛠️ **Tools Explored:**
- Terraform & AWS CLI for AWS infrastructure
- Jenkins, Sonarqube, Terraform, Kubectl, and more for CI/CD setup
- Helm, Prometheus, and Grafana for Monitoring
- ArgoCD for GitOps practices

🚢 **High-Level Overview:**
